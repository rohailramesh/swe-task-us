# Software Engineering Task: WebSocket Server and Client

## Overview

This project is a submission for a software engineering assignment involving the development of a full-stack application using Node.js (with TypeScript) for the server side and React (with TypeScript) for the client side. The project focuses on building a WebSocket server that sends information to a React client, which then displays the information in a user-friendly manner suitable for a DevOps team.

## Features

- **WebSocket Server**: Built with Node.js and TypeScript, the server periodically fetches data from multiple endpoints and sends updates to connected clients using WebSockets.
- **React Client**: A client-side application built with React and TypeScript that receives data from the WebSocket server and displays it in an organized format using Ant Design components.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues, such as endpoint unavailability or timeouts, and handling multiple client connections.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Vercel (client) and Render (server) for easy access and review.
- **Bonus Points**: Implemented caching to reduce server load and prevent endpoint overloading. Attempted unit/integration tests to validate server functionality.

## Project Structure

- **Server**: The server-side code is located in the `/server` directory and contains the WebSocket server implementation.
- **Client**: The client-side code is located in the `/client` directory and contains the React application.
